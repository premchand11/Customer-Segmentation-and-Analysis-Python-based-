# Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

This project demonstrates customer segmentation using the K-Means clustering algorithm. Customer segmentation helps businesses to identify distinct groups of customers based on their behavior and characteristics, enabling targeted marketing strategies and personalized customer experiences.

## Project Overview

In this project, we utilize K-Means clustering, a popular unsupervised machine learning algorithm, to segment customers into different groups based on their purchasing behavior. The project involves loading a dataset, preprocessing the data, applying the K-Means algorithm, and visualizing the results.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing data, feature scaling, and other preprocessing steps to prepare the data for clustering.
- **K-Means Clustering**: Implementing the K-Means algorithm to group customers into distinct clusters.
- **Visualization**: Plotting the clusters and their centroids to interpret the results.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project includes various features such as customer ID, age, annual income, spending score, etc. The dataset is preprocessed before applying the K-Means algorithm.

## Implementation

### 1. Data Loading and Preprocessing

The data is loaded from a CSV file and undergoes preprocessing steps including:
- Handling missing values.
- Normalizing features to bring them onto a similar scale.

### 2. K-Means Clustering

The K-Means algorithm is applied to the preprocessed data:
- **Choosing the number of clusters (k)**: The optimal number of clusters is determined using the Elbow method.
- **Fitting the model**: The model is trained on the dataset to assign customers to clusters.

### 3. Visualization

The clusters are visualized using various plots:
- **Scatter Plot**: Displaying the clusters and their centroids.
- **Cluster Distribution**: Showing the number of customers in each cluster.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/customer-segmentation-kmeans.git
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd customer-segmentation-kmeans
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   gpip install -r requirements.txt
4. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Customer_Segmentation_using_K_Means_Clustering.ipynb

## Results
The K-Means clustering results show distinct groups of customers with similar purchasing behaviours. The clusters can be used to design targeted marketing strategies, improve customer satisfaction, and increase sales.
